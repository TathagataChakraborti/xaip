The world of Explainable AI is rapidly expanding in scope from mundane classification tasks 
to more complex decision-making processes where automated algorithms play an outsized role. 
The International Workshop of Explainable AI Planning (XAIP) brings together the latest and 
best in the field of explainable planning and sequential decision-making. 
The workshop is collocated with ICAPS, the premier conference on automated planning and scheduling.
