# XAIP Workshop Series @ ICAPS

The world of Explainable AI is rapidly expanding in scope from mundane classification tasks 
to more complex decision-making processes where automated algorithms play an outsized role. 
The International Workshop of Explainable AI Planning (XAIP) brings together the latest and 
best in the field of explainable planning and sequential decision-making. 
The workshop is collocated with ICAPS, the premier conference on automated planning and scheduling.

## How to Contribute? :nerd_face:

There are several ways to join the XAIP community! 

### Submit to XAIP @ ICAPS 2021

The call for contributions to the 4th edition of XAIP is out! 
ICAPS 2021 will be held in Guangzhou, at Sun Yat-Sen University during June 7-12, 2021. 
The XAIP Workshop, as well as ICAPS itself, will either at least have a hybrid presence 
in the likely scenario that a fully physical event cannot be held in summer.
